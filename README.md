# GoodDay
Lambda function to call twitter api and tell me what today is a good day for

Very simple function that calls the api using a bearer token environment variable, and returns what people are saying "it's a good day to".
This was going to be turned into a website or something but I don't want to pay for twitter api so it'll probably stay as is...
